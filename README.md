This project encompasses a series of tasks centered on predictive modeling and 
data analysis, aiming to solve diverse real-world problems using various datasets. 
Each task involves developing, training, and evaluating models to predict specific 
outcomes, spanning multiple domains including healthcare, education, finance, 
biology, business, and consumer behavior. 

Task Overview 

Task 1: Cancer Prediction 
o Objective: Develop a model to predict the presence of cancer based 
on patient data. 
o Data: Medical records with features such as age, tumor size, and other 
relevant biomarkers. 
o Approach: Use classification algorithms to predict whether a patient 
has cancer. 

Task 2: Chance of Admission 
o Objective: Predict the likelihood of a student being admitted to a 
university based on their application profile. 
o Data: Student profiles with features like GRE scores, GPA, and 
extracurricular activities. 
o Approach: Use regression or classification techniques to estimate 
admission probabilities. 

Task 3: Credit Card Default Prediction 
o Objective: Predict whether a credit card holder will default on their 
payment. 
o Data: Credit card holder data including transaction history, credit 
score, and payment behaviour. 
o Approach: Use classification models to identify potential defaulters. 

Task 4: Fish Weight Prediction 
o Objective: Predict the weight of fish based on its features. 
o Data: Fish dataset with features such as length, height, and width. 
o Approach: Use regression analysis to predict fish weight. 

Task 5: Ice Cream Revenue Prediction 
o Objective: Forecast ice cream sales revenue based on various factors. 
o Data: Historical sales data with features such as temperature, day of 
the week, and promotional activities. 
o Approach: Use time series analysis and regression models to predict 
revenue. 

Task 6: Galton's Height Data Linear Regression 
o Objective: Analyze the relationship between parents' and children's 
heights. 
o Data: Galton's height dataset including heights of parents and their 
children. 
o Approach: Apply linear regression to study the inheritance of height.

Task 7: Customer Purchase Prediction & Effect of Micro-Numerosity 
o Objective: Predict customer purchase behavior and analyze the 
impact of micro-numerosity on purchasing decisions. 
o Data: Customer purchase data with features such as product price, 
quantity, and promotional factors. 
o Approach: Use classification and regression techniques to predict 
purchases and study behavioral effects.
